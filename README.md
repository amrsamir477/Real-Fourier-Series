# Interactive Fourier Series in Matplotlib
Visualize the Fourier series for any real periodic function!
To obtain this program, first download the files `app.py` and `animate.py` and ensure that they are in the same directory.  Make sure that you have the latest version of Python with Tkinter, Matplotlib, Numpy, and Sympy installed. You can then use this program by running `app.py`. You should see the Fourier series of the rectangle function expressed in terms of rotating complex exponentials.

To visualize the Fourier series of a different function, you can choose one of the preset functions in the `Preset Waveform f(t)`drop down menu, or you can enter a new function in the `Enter waveform f(t)` entry box. The animation speed can be changed by moving the `Animation Speed` slider. To close the app, click `QUIT`.
